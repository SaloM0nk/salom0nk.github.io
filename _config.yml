  Hello! I am a researcher, software developer, network architect, and security engineer based in Hamburg, Germany. In May 2025, I changed my name from Timo Häckel to Timo Salomon due to marriage.

  Currently, I am pursuing a doctoral degree in cooperation with the Technical University of Dresden, and Hamburg University of Applied Sciences in Germany. 
  My particular interest is the tightly intertwined safety and security of time-sensitive in-vehicle networks, which I am exploring in the context of different research projects. 
  I am a member of the CoRE and INET working groups at HAW Hamburg, where I develop and maintain open-source frameworks for the OMNeT++ simulator. 

  Approaching my doctorate, I am looking for opportunities to apply my experience to network and security projects in industry. 
  Feel free to explore my work and get in touch.
